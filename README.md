This is the game made by C++ using MFC as the final project of for the OOP course at college.

In order to play the game you must install visual studio 2019 with MFC packages and after that load the content of the repo into a new empty MFC project created.

Or you can just use the install in the Dodger Setup.zip file.

The program was compiled with 32 bit program, So whenever you install it on a 64bit system it will throw some sounds of errors but it will work perfectly after few seconds so please be patient.
